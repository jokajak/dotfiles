# Hammerspoon Configuration

This configuration is heavily influenced by awesome-hammerspoon and ki.

I am using a Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard with the Delete key mapped to the hyper key.

Using ⌘+escape to enter normal mode then allows me to use the following transitions:

* ⌘+a -> Application selector
* ⌘+c -> Show current application shortcuts
* ⌘+u -> Quick URL Access
* ⌘+v -> Volume control
* ⌘+w -> Quick URL Access
* v -> VIM Mode (from VimMode.spoon)

## TODO

* [ ] Switch MicMute key to FN when keyboard not present
* [ ] Create window/tab selector shortcut
* [ ] Create mode for controlling spotify

## Hyper key shortcuts

### General

* Hyper + A --> Application selector
* Hyper + C --> Show current application shortcuts
* Hyper + U --> URL mode
* Hyper + V --> Volume control
* Hyper + W --> Window positioning management
