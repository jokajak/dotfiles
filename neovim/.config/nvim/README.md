# kickstart-modular.nvim

## Introduction

*This is a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that moves from a single file to a multi file configuration.*

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Modular
* Completely Documented

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.

## Overview

This is created to be my personal development environment. My main languages are:

* scripting
    * bash
* programming
    * python
    * rust (in the future maybe)
* infrastructure as code
    * ansible
    * terraform
    * kubernetes
